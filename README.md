# Web3ATLNFT

Website built for Blockchain @ GT to claim the NFTs associated with the conference held in Atlanta. Any person who attended for any particular type of role
is eligible for a NFT. The NFTs are specific and different for each role of the person who attended (Speaker/Hacker/Atendee/Team).

It is built using React.js and Bootstrap/CSS. It interacts with the backend using Firebase and interacts with a smart contract using the ABI in the local 
file directory. It is also managed by the React Router to create an admin dashboard in case of having to add users to the database of people who attended 
the conference. The website when ran interacts with Metamask on the Optimism network to claim it properly. The website is publicly available 
using https://nft.web3atl.io/ and the route for admins is available at https://nft.web3atl.io/admin.
